# My Personal Project

## Airline Ticketing System

An airline ticketing system which allows you to find the best deal for flights provided by reknowned airline, "Air UBC". The user will create an account with "Air UBC" after which the system will display flights to several destinations across the planet with the time, duration and cost of flights in the coming week. The application will also provide luxury seating upgrade options and additional baggage services where applicable.

This application is suitable for anyone looking to check and compare flight costs and durations, add luggage, and book safe flights to their home countries and holiday destinations.

I chose this project because as an international student, I've always faced problems with booking economical flight tickets to and from my home country. I want to build an application that can eventually develop into something that could be of real use.



- As a user, I want to be able to make an account in the system, where I enter my personal information and add it to a list of accounts.
- As a user, I want to be able to view flights to various destinations  around the world.
- As a user, I want to be able to book the flight of my choice.
- As a user, I want to be able to add additional baggage.
- As a user, I want to be able to upgrade to business or first class at a flight.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my bookings to the file when I'm quitting my application.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my previous bookings when I start the aplication.
